# snake

Create a folder called "assets" in the same directory as the "snake" package. Put bomb.png and apple.pngin it. There is no need to transfer the highscores.txt files. If the program can't find it, it will create a generic one. If you would like to replace the highscores.txt file, then place it into the same directory as the src folder.
